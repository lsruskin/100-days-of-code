# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sunday, June 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**:  Currently sorting out my environment. I have ubuntu VM desktop loaded on VMWare Desktop Pro on my Windows desktop & Ubuntu desktop loaded on my old Samsung N150 netbook. Now VM and netbook upgraded to latest release 17.04. This was done by running update-manager on ubuntu 16.04 (original install) to update os release to latest release.

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with javascript, but it is getting better. Still learning about git.

**Today's Progress**: Working through javascript challenges - basic algorithm scripting. Reviewed 'Seek and Destroy'.

**Thoughts**: I understand the basics of coding but in the process of getting used to the approach in javascript.
