# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Sunday, June 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**:  Currently sorting out my environment. I have ubuntu VM desktop loaded on VMWare Desktop Pro on my Windows desktop & Ubuntu desktop loaded on my old Samsung N150 netbook. Now VM and netbook upgraded to latest release 17.04. This was done by running update-manager on ubuntu 16.04 (original install) to update os release to latest release.

**Thoughts:** I am struggling with javascript, but it is getting better. Still learning about git.

**Today's Progress**: Working through javascript challenges - basic algorithm scripting. Reviewed 'Seek and Destroy'.

**Thoughts**: I understand the basics of coding but in the process of getting used to the approach in javascript.

### Day 2: Tuesday, June 13, 2017 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: JQuery syntax. Running code provided on Free Code Camp

**Thoughts:** I am still trying to absorb and remember techniques in javascript. JQuery is a whole new type of syntax. Need to revisit this and appreciate a) what it does and b) how it is written c) how it links in with my existing knowledge of code. 

**Links to Work**: Didn't really 'write' new code. Copied examples into existing examples and ran them to see how they worked. Need to appreciate style of writing this and what is does so can use it in future.
